# Project Title: AI-Driven Music Composition

## Abstract

In the world of Generative AI, the past few years have seen a remarkable surge, driven by the advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence. This project leverages this transformative wave, harnessing state-of-the-art AI models such as LSTM and DCGAN's GAN, along with various music representations like MelSpectrograms and Piano Rolls, to revolutionize the landscape of music composition. Our goal is to eliminate the constraints that have traditionally hindered creative expression in music, enabling the swift and coherent generation of multitrack compositions across a wide range of genres. The project envisions a future where AI and human expertise work together seamlessly, fostering a dynamic interplay between technological innovation and artistic creativity. Through an intuitive interface, musicians and enthusiasts alike can engage in real-time interaction with AI-generated music, sparking a harmonious fusion of technical prowess and creative ingenuity.

## Introduction

High costs, time constraints, and limited genre exploration are common obstacles in traditional music creation. Our project aims to revolutionize music production by enabling fast, coherent, and diverse multitrack generation using LSTM and GAN. It explores the intersection of art and technology in music generation, where LSTM and GAN reshape music composition, production, and creativity, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## Methodology

The project is divided into the following key components:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering a diverse dataset of musical compositions and preprocessing them to be used for training the AI models.
2. Model Training: Training LSTM and GAN models on the preprocessed dataset, experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using various metrics and comparing them to human-generated compositions.
